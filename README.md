# Project Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- npx (Node Package Executor)

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

\`\`\`sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HRDept-Frontend-Interview-Exercise.git
\`\`\`

Navigate to the project directory:

\`\`\`sh
cd HRDept-Frontend-Interview-Exercise
\`\`\`

## Installing Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies by running:

\`\`\`sh
npm install
\`\`\`

## Running the Project

To start the development server:

1. Navigate to the \`src\` directory:

    \`\`\`sh
    cd src
    \`\`\`

2. Run the following command to start the development server:

    \`\`\`sh
    npm run dev
    \`\`\`

## Starting the JSON Server

To start the JSON server:

\`\`\`sh
npx json-server db.json
\`\`\`

## Important Note

The API is only available locally. To call the API, you must clone the project and run it on your local machine.

## Accessing the Application

Once the development server and JSON server are running, you can access the application in your web browser at:

\`\`\`sh
http://localhost:3000
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure all dependencies are installed and the servers are running. Check the terminal output for any error messages and follow the suggestions to resolve them.
